# Week 10 Homework

## Battleship

* I've always been a fan of the game Battleship.
* I figured I would be able to easily recreate it in Javascript
* It took a bit to determine how to create a few of the features

## Change in idea
* I wanted my battleship to be a single player game
* The game would generate ships and place them
* The player would then need to issue commands on where to hit.

### Issues Encountered/Solved
* It was a pain to determine on how to make the ships actually fit the grid.
* They would at first collide or intersect or be outside of the grid.
* The grid was byfar the easiest thing to make.
* Creating the ships, checking the ships, and collision were by far tedious.
* It was really easy to check if a ship was hit or if the attack was a miss.
